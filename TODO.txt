TODO:
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
- Add learned exotic assembly effects to Password System when using DRLA
- Shop and Locker systems need to handle set bonuses properly, specifically in a called function

Bugs:
- Target dummy doesn't show damage numbers after it's killed?
- Chainsaw icon and behavior in shop/locker is really weird for some reason
- Investigate: Unknown P-Code 721048 in script "::MonsterRegenerationHandler"
- Multiplayer Player health bars are not showing the fills of the proper players
- PLZ2TEST: Archvile resurrection. Test the fuck out of it.

Launcher:
- Load Order System

Rewrites:
- Health Bar Script, needs to be properly redone and seperated into multiple functions
- Input Checking, should be re-written to use the generic CheckInput() method
- Shields, should just be rewritten to not suck in general
- Item and Monster Databases, for mod compatibility and allowing the creation of seperate patches outside the main library
- Locker, seperated into it's own file and split handling into functions and less repeated code
- Password System, re-write to use one hex string instead of 40+ CVARs, also rename it since Password isn't accurate anymore
? Replace "Static" address space with a new DRPGStatic address space which references a different array (May not be necessary?)
